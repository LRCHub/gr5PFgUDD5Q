The double you, the double me
A mirror where one could see the ancestry
You dare to look the double we

The side of you open and free
Waiting for love tuned to beauty
Spirit of giving naturally
Exchanging all simplicity

The natural child
With strong legs and shoulders
Was made to carry a load way too heavy

Still you were able to raise
Resonate with some loftier way
So high perhaps and without fear
Which made you embrace the mystery
That tormented you

Now that you are
Traveling and finding a new way
And although I miss you

Now that you are one
And that I am still two
I can connect at last
To your presence revealed

The peace and the knowledge
That you are well
That all is well
