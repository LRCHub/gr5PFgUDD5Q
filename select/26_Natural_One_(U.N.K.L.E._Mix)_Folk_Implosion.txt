I'm the one natural one, make it easy
We can take it inside
Where I can love how I like if I want it
Whatever keeps me high

Yeah, we can take it
Good and loose on an endless spree
Good because we made it
And when momma's not around
There's no telling what we'll do when we're free

I'm the one natural one, make it easy
We can take it inside
I can have it cause I act like I love it
It's a matter of pride

Yeah, we can take it
Good excuse for an endless spree
Good because we made it
And if the world is falling down,
It may as well crash with me

When I'm numb natural one
It's the one natural one
(There's no telling what we'll do when we're free)
When I'm numb natural one
(There's no telling what we'll do when we're free)
It's the one natural one
(And you may as well crash with me)
When I'm numb natural one
(There's no telling what we'll do when we're free)
It's the one natural one
(There's no telling what we'll do when we're free)
When I'm numb natural one
(There's no telling what we'll do when we're free)
It's the one natural one
(And you may as well crash with me)
