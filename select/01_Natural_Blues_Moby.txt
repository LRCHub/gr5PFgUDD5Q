Oh Lordy, my trouble's so hard

Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Oh Lordy, my trouble's so hard

Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Went down the hill the other day
Soul get happy and stayed all day
Went down the hill the other day
Soul get happy, I stayed all day

Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

I went in the room, I didn't stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead
I went in the room, didn't stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, my God
Oh, oh

Oh Lordy, my trouble's so hard
Oh Lordy, my trouble's so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Oh Lordy, my trouble's so hard
