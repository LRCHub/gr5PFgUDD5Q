[00:31.42] Close 'em up, close your eyes up real tight
[00:36.67] I could write you a novel tonight
[00:41.51] I could write a new song each day
[00:47.15] It's a natural part of my day
[01:01.65] 
[00:52.58] Me and you the exact same white light
[01:17.53] I could write a novel tonight
[01:23.59] I could write a new song each day
[01:27.95] It's a natural part of my day
[01:42.45] 
[01:53.26] I want you
[02:12.31] I want you to be happy
[02:29.38] To be happy
